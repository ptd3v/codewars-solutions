# Who Likes it? (6th Kyu)
# Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item.

# My Solution:
def likes(names):
    n = len(names)
    if n == 0:
        return ("no one likes this")
    elif n == 1:
        return f"{names[0]} likes this"
    elif n == 2:
        return f"{names[0]} and {names[1]} like this"
    elif n == 3:
        return f"{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {names[2]} like this"
    else:
        return f"{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {n - 2} others like this"

# Community Solution:
def likes(names):
    n = len(names)
    return {
        0: 'no one likes this',
        1: '{} likes this', 
        2: '{} and {} like this', 
        3: '{}, {} and {} like this', 
        4: '{}, {} and {others} others like this'
    }[min(4, n)].format(*names[:3], others=n-2)
